The core concept is divisibility and how it relates to broader number-theoretic principles. The division theorem forms the bedrock for many number-theoretic proofs and applications, extending into areas like cryptography, computer science (e.g., hashing algorithms), and abstract algebra.', examples=['**Example 1 (Division Theorem):**  Let $a = 27$ and $b = 5$.

This illustrates the division theorem with a concrete example.', '**Example 2 (Divisibility Property IV):**  We know that $2 \\\\mid 6$ and $6 \\\\mid 18$.  Therefore, according to property IV, $2 \\\\mid 18$, which is true.', '**Example 3 (Application of Property VII):** Given that $3 \\\\mid 9$ and $3 \\\\mid 12$, we can say that $3$ divides any linear combination of $9$ and $12$. For instance, $3 \\\\mid (9 \\\\cdot 2 + 12 \\\\cdot (-1)) = 3 \\\\mid (18 - 12) = 3 \\\\mid 6$, which is correct.'], reflection=\"These notes provide a solid foundation for understanding divisibility and its related theorems.  The clarity of the notation and the step-by-step proofs are beneficial. I appreciate the connection made to the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, showcasing the importance of the division theorem. It reinforces my understanding that seemingly simple concepts can be foundational to more complex mathematical ideas. The properties of divisibility are particularly interesting, hinting at modular arithmetic and congruence relations, which I've encountered before.\", questions=['How does the Division Theorem extend to the set of all integers (including negative numbers)?  The notes specify $b \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}$, but what if $b$ is negative?', 'The notes mention that the division theorem is useful when dealing with expressions like  $4q, 4q+1, 4q+2, 4q+3$. Can you provide a specific example or context where this representation is crucial (e.g., proving a property related to even or odd numbers)?', 'How is the Division Theorem used in the proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic? The notes mention its importance, but a deeper explanation of the connection would be insightful.']),\n",
